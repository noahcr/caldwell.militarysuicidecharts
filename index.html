		<p>Suicide among U.S. military veterans has been a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/02/03/clay-hunt-veterans-suicide-prevention-act-passes-in-senate-will-head-to-white-house/">major social and political issue</a> in America as more and more soldiers return from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. But active-duty service members, new data show, are also at a much higher risk of suicide than the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/nvsr.htm">general population</a> - and are more likely to use a gun to do the job.</p>

		<p>Prior to 2008, the Department of Defense kept no data on suicides across each of the four main branches of military (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force). That year, the newly-released <a href="http://www.dspo.mil/SuicideData/DoDSERAnnualReports.aspx">"Suicide Event Report"</a> began compiling annual suicide statistics on active-duty personnel. Just last month the DOD released its latest "Suicide Event Report," for 2014.</p>

		<p>With U.S. troops conducting <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/0814_Inherent-Resolve">airstrikes in Iraq</a> against the Islamic State, and more than <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/08/hundreds-us-troops-deployed-afghanistan-taliban-helmand">5,000 troops<a/> indefinitely on the ground in Afghanistan, this issue won't be going away any time soon. Here are four graphs that make sense of the new data - and how soldiers having guns nearby can lead to higher suicide rates in soldiers.</p>

	<h1>1) Since 2008, active-duty military personnel are far more likely to commit suicide than the general American population.</h1>

	<h1>2) Active-duty soldiers are also more likely to use a firearm, whether it's their military-issued gun or a personal weapon kept on base or at home.</h1>

	<h1>3) Soldiers are far more likely to "complete" a suicide attempt if they use a firearm. Almost two-thirds of completed suicides involve a firearm, whereas a mere 6.24% of unsuccessful attempts involve a firearm.<h1>

	<h1>4) The high prevalence of guns in "completed" suicides is mirrored in the data showing how often guns were present in the immediate environment of the victim. This chart and the chart above suggest that suicidal soldiers with accessible firearms are far more likely to die of a suicide attempt.</h1>

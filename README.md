Behind the Scenes - Active Duty Soldiers More Likely To Commit Suicide

In January, I stumbled upon the U.S. Department of Defense’s annual Suicide Event Report (SER), and started to poke around. The data was incredibly granular, documenting every tiny detail for every suicide completed or attempted by active duty soldiers - their living situation at the time, their combat history, their recent relationships. 

A few things jumped out. Soldiers are far more likely to kill themselves with a firearm than by any other method (over 70% in 2014, for example). Conversely, soldiers who didn’t use a gun were far more likely to survive the incident. Given these two points, it’s unsurprising to see that the presence of a gun in the home was far more likely in “completed” suicides (there isn’t a much more graceful way to differentiate from “attempts,” unfortunately). 

I started looking at SERs from past years, hoping to get a few decades of data to compare. Did soldiers start to commit suicide at a higher rate after 9/11, for example? But the data stopped at 2008. This in itself is a story worth telling - before 2008, the DOD kept no service-wide data about its soldiers killing themselves. Individual branches (the Army, the Marines) kept some data, but none of it was compiled and often it wasn’t made public in the first place. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan pressed on, the DOD was pressured to investigate suicides, and in 2008 the first SER protocol was set up.

But it was far from perfect. To a data journalist, the different editions of the SER were frustrating. For the first few years, they didn’t keep ANY data on suicide attempts. Some fields weren’t filled in at all until later years, and the format of the tables differed with each edition (for example, for a few years they summarized data in the first half of the document, then had an appendix with all the tables at the end, without context). But I dug around a bit, and ended up with four Excel sheets: 

- Suicides in the US as a whole vs. suicides within the U.S. military (the U.S. data came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

- The % of suicides within each of those populations that used a firearm

- The % of soldier suicides versus soldier suicide attempts that used a firearm

- The % of soldier suicides versus soldier suicide attempts where a firearm was in the home at the time.



Based on this data, the story seemed clear - there were four successive points to make:

1. Active duty soldiers are far more likely to kill themselves than the average U.S. population.

2. Soldiers are also more likely to use a firearm in the act.

3. When soldiers use a gun, they are far more likely to “complete” the act.

4. Having a gun in the home meant soldiers were far more likely to “complete” the act.
